# Library-Management-System

#### This project is a Library Management System designed using SQL for database management. Let's break down the steps and explain each part.

### Database Creation: 
The project starts by creating a database named library.

### Tables Creation: 
Six tables are created
Branch: Stores information about library branches.
Employee: Contains details of library staff.
Books: Stores information about the books available in the library.
Customer: Contains details of library customers.
IssueStatus: Tracks books issued to customers.
ReturnStatus: Tracks books returned by customers.

### Inserting Data: 
Data is inserted into each table to populate them with initial information. This includes branch details, employee information, book details, customer details, and records of issued and returned books.
### Queries:
Various SQL queries are provided to perform operations on the database.
1.Retrieve available books with their titles, categories, and rental prices.
2.List employee names and salaries in descending order of salary.
3.Retrieve book titles and the customers who have issued those books.
4.Display the total count of books in each category.
5.Retrieve employee names and positions for those with salaries above Rs. 50,000.
6.List customer names who registered before a certain date and have not issued any books.
7.Display branch numbers and the total count of employees in each branch.
8.Display customer names who issued books in a specific month.
9.Retrieve book titles containing the word "history".
10.Retrieve branch numbers with a count of employees for branches having more than 5 employees.
#### Each query performs a specific task, such as retrieving data, filtering results, or aggregating information, to provide insights into the library system.
#### Overall, this project demonstrates the creation of a relational database for managing library operations, including book inventory, customer interactions, and employee management, along with various SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the database.
